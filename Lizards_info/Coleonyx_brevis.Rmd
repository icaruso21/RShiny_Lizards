**Description**  
&emsp;*Coleonyx brevis* is a nocturnal gecko that inhabits xeric environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.  
&emsp;They typically start their activity immediately after sunset, and it extends until early morning. *C. brevis* is eurythermic, making exposures to variable thermal conditions during this time interval possible. Their mean body temperature at night is lower than their preferred temperature, which represents a compromise for nocturnality. During the daytime, they stay under cover such as rocks warmed up by the sun and alter body positions to maximize the efficiency of digestion.
