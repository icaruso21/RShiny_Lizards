**Description**  
&emsp;The short-horned lizard, *Phrynosoma douglasii*, is a species of lizard that ranges from southwestern Canada to the northwestern United States.  
&emsp;This species of lizard is well adapted to high altitudes because of their notably low critical thermal minimum. *P. douglasii* is capable of movement at body temperatures nearly as low as those tolerated by a species living at 4575 m (Prieto & Whitford, 1971). They also don't use rodent burrows or burrowing under loose soil at night to avoid the cold (Guyer & Linder, 1985). This high tolerance enables them to be active at a wide range of temperatures. Lizards of this genus can be active earlier and later in the day, and thus over a longer time than most other sympatric species of lizards. Therefore, their body temperature variability is greater than that of any other North American iguanid (Guyer & Linder, 1985).  
&emsp;On the other hand, their critical thermal maximum is relatively low, which makes them vulnerable to the continuous increase in temperature that is likely to happen.
