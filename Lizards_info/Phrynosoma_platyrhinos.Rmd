**Description**  
&emsp;*Phrynosoma platyrhinos*, or the desert horned lizard, is a species of lizard that prefers an arid or semi-arid environment with access to open ground.  
&emsp;The variance in body temperature of active *P. platyrhinos* is significantly greater than that of most other lizards occupying similar habitats (Pianka & Parker, 1975). This is reflected in the long activity time of this species. This extended activity time is needed because *P. platyrhinos* is an ant specialist. Ants' exoskeletons are made of chitin — a carbohydrate resistant to degredation — so ant feeders need a large stomach to consume a lot of ants (Pianka & Parker, 1975). Their large stomachs reduce movement, but their foraging time must remain sufficiently long to secure resources. The longer foraging time and shorter thermoregulation inevitably contribute to a more variable body temperature. The increased risk of predation from the slow movement and longer feeding time is compensated for by their cryptic coloration and sharp spines.  
&emsp;Although thermoregulation is relaxed for this species, when the air temperature exceeds 39°C, lizards move either in shade or under the soil to avoid overheating (Newbold & MacMahon, 2014). Reduced available activity time from climate change can be detrimental.

<!-- *P. platyrhinos* has a strong preference for microhabitats with soil mounds since they are cooler than flat ground due to increased convection and air circulation (Newbold & MacMahon, 2014). Additionally, the mounds warm more quickly during the cooler morning, which is beneficial for the lizards.   -->
