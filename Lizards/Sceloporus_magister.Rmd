**Description**  
&emsp;*Sceloporus magister*, the desert spiny lizard, is widely distributed in western North America. They can be found in a variety of habitat types including rocky areas in canyons, foothills, and typical flatland deserts.  
&emsp;*S. magister* is active over a narrower range of body temperatures than other lizards that occupy similar habitats due to their relatively low tolerance for high temperatures (Parker & Pianka, 1973). To maximize activity time, this species uses shallow rock crevices as retreat sites overnight to get full exposure to the early morning warm temperature (McGinnis & Falkenstein, 1971). This allows them to start their activity early before retreating to deep shade midday to avoid overheating. They don't normally move through a diverse thermal environment nor expend energy making long runs. This reduced metabolic heat gain also contributes to the narrow temperature range (Parker & Pianka, 1973).
